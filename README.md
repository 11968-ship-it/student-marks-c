# Student Marks Management System (C)

A simple C program to analyze student marks.

## Description
A C program that:
* reads student marks
* calculates average
* highest and lowest scores
* assigns a final grade

The project is built using a modular design with header files

## Features
- Input marks for multiple subjects
- Calculate average, highest, and lowest marks
- Determine grade based on average

## Program flow and structure designed using Figma

## App Design (Figma)
The application UI and user flow were designed using Figma to visualize how the C program could be extended into a desktop application.
The design reflects the underlying modular structure of the codebase.
